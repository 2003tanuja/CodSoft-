It uses the OpenCV library to offer image processing and computer vision tools. The system of recognizing and detecting faces is one part, live webcam feed another of two main components for this code.

In the code, a pre-trained Haar cascade classifier (haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml) is used to detect faces in an image file that is specified by the variable image_path. It then draws rectangles around the detected faces. The detect_faces_image function shows the output image containing the detected faces by using OpenCV's imshow function.

It uses the VideoCapture function to grab video frames from the webcam for live, on-the-fly face detection. It then makes rectangles for detected faces around each of the frames using the same face detection technique. It continues to do so until terminated by the user pressing 'q.'

Summing up, the system exploits OpenCV computer vision to provide an easy but effective way of detecting and recognizing faces in both still images and live video.
