There are rules for this one Python chatbot. To converse with people, the bot offers replies to various inquiries and requests which include greetings, asking who it is, cracking jokes, weather questions etc. The suggestions and information that the bot would give you are based on some key words or phrases found in what you said. Python code takes user input, applies conditionals and invokes python standard functions to yield responses that are relevant. Chatterbots can allow two individuals to have a dialogue up until they determine to stop through saying “bye”. Further expanding or modifying the code will make it more robust and speed up its response time.
